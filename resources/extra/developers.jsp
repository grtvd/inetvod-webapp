		<h3>Software Developers</h3>

		<p>From day 1, Storm has been about creating an open video platform around a set of open player APIs.
			Shortly we will be releasing those APIs allowing anyone to build a ‘player’ that can connect to the
			Storm servers.</p>

		<p>StormMediaPlayer.com is just one of the players. Our goal is to have many different types of
			players, running on all sorts of devices and platforms. A player could be a widget or a gadget, a
			plug-in for Windows Media Center, TiVo, or an open source media player, for example. A player might
			be an interface running a mobile phone, or an Internet device. Eventually, a player might be a
			module in a dedicated TV set-top box.</p>

		<p>Stay tuned…</p>

		<h3>Graphics Artists</h3>

		<p>The idea of Storm is about giving control back to the users.  It’s about allowing users to access a
			wide variety of Internet-based videos through a single user interface instead of having to navigate
			to a bunch of different sites, each with their own interfaces and own set of features.</p>

		<p>That said, we don’t think Storm is about a particular look or style.  It’s flexible enough to take on
			a variety of appearances based on a user’s preference.</p>

		<p>If you’re a graphic artist, we’re inviting you to submit your design ideas for Storm.  A future
			release of StromMediaPlayer.com will support skinning, featuring the works of the Storm
			community.</p>

		<p>Stay tuned…</p>
